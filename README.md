## Why Objects?

This plugin was built for a specific kind of note-taker: **The Obsidian Lover who misses Objects.**

If you've experimented with apps like **Anytype** or **Capacities** because you loved their object-oriented approach, but ultimately found yourself returning to the power, privacy, and flexibility of **Obsidian**, then this is for you.

**Objects** brings that missing piece to your vault. No more manual folder navigation or messy template applications—just pure, structured creation without leaving your keyboard.

## What it does

**Objects** bridges the gap between thinking and documenting. Instead of breaking your creative flow to manually create files, navigate folders, or apply templates, you simply define "Objects" (like `@person`, `@meeting`, or `@atomic-note`) and trigger them anywhere.

- **Unified Workflow**: Creation, organization, and linking happen in one single interaction.
- **Smart Routing**: Notes are automatically moved to their designated folders based on their type.
- **Dynamic Content**: Uses a powerful fallback system (`{{title}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`) or integrates natively with [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).
- **Intelligent Linking**: If an object already exists, the plugin links to it instead of creating a duplicate.
- **Property Management**: Automatically add frontmatter properties (e.g., `type: project`) to newly created notes.
- **Archive Awareness**: Define tags or properties to mark notes as archived, excluding them from your active suggestion flow.

## Try it out (Demo Vault)

To see **Objects** in action without configuring anything, check out our **Demo Vault**:

1.  Download the `demo/Objects-Demo-Vault` folder from this repository.
2.  Open Obsidian and select **"Open folder as vault"**.
3.  Choose the downloaded `Objects-Demo-Vault` folder.
4.  Open the `Welcome.md` file inside the vault for a quick guided tour.

The demo vault is pre-configured with sample templates, folders, and triggers to show you the power of object-oriented note-taking.

## How to use it

1.  **Trigger**: Type `@` (or your custom symbol) followed by the object type (e.g., `@project`) anywhere in your editor.
2.  **Identify**: A suggestion list appears—select your desired object.
3.  **Name**: A modal pops up. Type the name of your new object (e.g., "Deep Work Initiative"). The modal will suggest existing notes based on your folder and property mappings.
4.  **Confirm**: Hit `Enter`.
5.  **Result**: A clean markdown link is inserted at your cursor. The note is created or linked in the background using your specified template and properties.

> [!TIP]
> **Trigger Conflicts**: If the `@` symbol is already being used by other plugins (like *Mention* or *Calendar*), you can easily change the **Trigger symbol** in the plugin settings to something else, like `#` or `!`. Existing mappings will update automatically.
